# Web Application Exercise

A little exercise to build a web application following an agile development process. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Product vision statement
This web application allows users to manage and manipulate data with functionalities to add, edit, delete, view, and search entries in a MongoDB database, providing a simple and mobile-friendly user experience.


## User stories

1\. As a user, I want to add data to the application so that I can store information for later use.

2\. As a user, I want to view all stored data so that I can see what has been saved.

3\. As a user, I want to edit existing data so that I can update information when needed. 

4\. As a user, I want to delete data that I no longer need. 

5\. As a user, I want to search for specific data so that I can quickly find what I am looking for.

6\. As an admin, I want to secure access to certain functionalities so that only authenticated users can perform data modifications.
